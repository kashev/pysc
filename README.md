A Scrabble cheater written in Python. Includes multiple dictionaries, including SOWPODS and the Words With Friends Dictionary.

# Requirements
You must have `python` version 3.4 or higher to run this script, for Python enumerations.

# Why
I wanted this software because the ability to use different dictionaries is important to me. `/usr/share/dict/words` isn't a Scrabble Competition dictionary.

# Thanks
- Thanks to [ScrabbleHelper](https://code.google.com/p/scrabblehelper/), a more complicated Java project, for the SOWPODS and TWL dictionary files.
- Thanks to [Blog My Brain](http://blogmybrain.com/words-with-friends-cheat/words-with-friends-dictionary.php) for the [Words With Friends](https://zynga.com/games/words-friends) dictionary.
- Thanks to [Justin Peel](http://stackoverflow.com/users/254617/justin-peel) for his useful analysis of this problem on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/5521619/1473320).
